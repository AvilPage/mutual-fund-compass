    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
        There are 1000+ mutual funds in each category. To find the right
        mutual fund, it takes a lot of time to filter out unwanted mutual funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to save multiple hours time each time I look for the right mutual fund,
        I have created this site to simplify the process.
    </p>

    <p>
        This site is completely open-source.
